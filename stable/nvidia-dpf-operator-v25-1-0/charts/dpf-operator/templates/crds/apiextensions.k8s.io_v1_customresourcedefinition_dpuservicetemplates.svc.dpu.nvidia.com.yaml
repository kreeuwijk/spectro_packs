          DPUServiceTemplate is the Schema for the DPUServiceTemplate API. This object is intended to be used in
          conjunction with a DPUDeployment object. This object is the template from which the DPUService will be created. It
          contains configuration options related to resources required by the service to be deployed. The rest of the
          configuration options must be defined in a DPUServiceConfiguration object.

                  baseline and are merged with values specified in the DPUServiceConfiguration. In case of conflict, the
                  DPUServiceConfiguration values take precedence.
