## Usage

To create a `StorageClass` of your choice, use the pack's values.yaml `charts.portworx-generic.storageClass` parameter section. To make a storageClass as a default storageClass, set the parameter `charts.portworx-generic.storageClass.isDefaultStorageClass` to `true` in `charts.portworx-generic.storageClass` section of pack's values.yaml. By default, the storageClass `spectro-storage-class` is created and used as the default storageClass.

## Licensing
License of type `Portworx Essentials` has reached end of life. So this software (any version) using that license stops working on May 1, 2025.
This pack also supports `Portworx CSI` license, to be used with Kubevirt
The default option is `Portworx Enterprise` license, which runs in 30-day trial mode when no license is provided.

Check out the [Palette Backup and Restore Documentation](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/clusters/cluster-management/backup-restore/) to learn how to backup and restore your cluster.

### Snapshot Creation

The Portworx generic pack supports snapshots by default. Snapshot creation requires the cluster profile to have the [Volume-Snapshot-controller](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/integrations/packs/?pack=volume-snapshot-controller) pack. You can add the Volume-Snapshot-controller pack to the cluster profile as an addon pack. Refer to the [Volume-Snapshot-controller](https://docs.spectrocloud.com/integrations/packs/?pack=volume-snapshot-controller) README for more information.
